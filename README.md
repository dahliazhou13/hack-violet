## inspiration
During the pandemic, womxn (especially those who are immunocompromised) have struggled to obtain sanitary and reproductive health products, such as pads and birth control. Many existing delivery services charge hefty fees, which are expensive and unfeasible for many.

## What it does
To solve these issues, we created Ivory. Ivory is a community-based delivery service specifically for sanitary and reproductive health products. Service fees are minimal, and anyone can join the delivery team by passing a background check. Deliverers can travel by car, bike, walking - however they wish! Ivory allows the community to come together and help one another.

## How we built it
On the front end, we used React, HTML, CSS to create a user-friendly UI. We use PostgreSQL to build a database to store all the orders, Heroku to deploy the API, GoogleMap API to display a map of the current location, and Node.js to add functionality to the web app.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challeng was to complete such a complicated project within the 24-hour limit while working virtually. Our members have time-zone differences, so we have to make sure to coordinate around that.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we have come up with this idea to tackle the lack of accessible sanitary and reproductive health products during the pandemic. A community-based delivery app that emphasizes on impacts instead of profits will help making delivery service more accessible. We have made a prototye with a working backend and user-friendly frontend within 24 hours.

## What we learned
Collaboration and communication are essenstial to developing a working product. Not only did we gain exposure to new technology and APIs, we also learned how to collarborate on a project virtually.

## What's next for Ivory
In the future, we want to:

- Implement more thorough background checks for new and current deliverers
- Connect with doctors who can prescribe birth control, antibiotics, etc. through Ivory
- Connect directly with pharmacies so Ivory can provide services to larger communities
- Use a strict monitoring system to ensure the safety of every customer and deliverer
